# NTFS to Netex France conversion

Version of the implementation: `1.0`

## Introduction

This document describes how a [NTFS feed](https://github.com/CanalTP/ntfs-specification/blob/master/ntfs_fr.md) is transformed into a Netex profil France feed in Navitia Transit Model.

The resulting ZIP archive is composed of:
- a `arrets.xml` file containing the description of all stops (Quays and StopPlaces)
- a `correspondances.xml` file containing all transfers between stops
- a `calendriers.xml` containing the services
- a folder for each network containing
  + TBD

## Schema Validation
To validate the produced XML document, you can use `xmllint` tool.  On a
Debian/Ubuntu environment, install the `libxml2-utils` package.

```shell
apt install libxml2-utils
```

On Windows, you can follow [these
instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19546854/installing-xmllint).

For validation, you need NeTEx schemas.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NeTEx-CEN/NeTEx.git
```

Then you can validate your file `my_file.xml` against NeTEx schema with the
following command.

```shell
xmllint --noout --nonet --huge --schema /path/to/NeTEx/xsd/NeTEx_publication.xsd my_file.xml
```

## Input parameters

A NTFS feed is not sufficient to generate a valid Netex Profil France feed:
- `ParticipantRef` : The ParticipantRef code must be provided,
- `StopProviderCode` : The code used to identify the provider in the stop_id generation.

## Id of objects

According to the Netex Specification, object identifiers should have a specific formatting.
For the other objects, the following format is used: **FR:[object type]:[object id]:**,
with a replacement of `:` by `_` in `object_id` to avoid conflict between separators.

## File headers

Each Netex file starts with a header containing some information generated by the program: 
- `/PublicationDelivery/@version`: **x.y:FR-NETEX_nnnn-a.b-c** with
  + `x.y`:  the version of Netex XSD of Netex (currently 1.09)
  + `nnnn`:identification of the profile ("FRANCE", "COMMUN", "ARRET",
"LIGNE", "RESEAU", "HORAIRE", "CALENDRIER" or "TARIF") 
  + `a.b` is the profile version (2.1)
  + `c` is the number of the local implementation (containing only integers and `.`). See at the top of the document.
- `/PublicationDelivery/PublicationTimestamp`: generation date of the Netex Feed using ISO8601,
- `/PublicationDelivery/ParticipantRef`: The value of the corresponding `ParticipantRef` parameter (see [input parameters](#input-parameters)).

Example: 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<PublicationDelivery xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
				xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.netex.org.uk/netex"
				xmlns="http://www.netex.org.uk/netex"
				xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
				xmlns:ifopt="http://www.ifopt.org.uk/ifopt"
				xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2"
				xmlns:core="http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/core"
				xmlns:siri="http://www.siri.org.uk/siri"
				version="1.09:FR-NETEX-2.1-1.0">
<PublicationTimestamp>2019-07-09T09:32:14Z</PublicationTimestamp>
<ParticipantRef>ABCD</ParticipantRef>
<dataObjects>...</dataObjects>
</PublicationDelivery>
```

## arrets.xml

A `stop_area` is considered monomodal if all the trips having stop_times referencing any of its stop_points have a physical_mode of the same "Netex mode".

### NeTEx Transport Modes
physical_mode_id | TransportMode in Netex
--- | --- 
Air | air
Boat | water
Bus | bus
BusRapidTransit | bus
Coach | coach
Ferry | water
Funicular | funicular
LocalTrain | rail
LongDistanceTrain | rail
Metro | metro
RapidTransit | rail
RailShuttle | rail
Shuttle | bus
SuspendedCableCar | cableway
Taxi | _ignored_
Train | rail
Tramway | tram

### Coordinates conversion

The GTFS stop_lon and stop_lat are specified in WGS84. The coordinates are converted to EPSG:2154 (Lambert 93).  
Example of Netex declaration:
><gml:pos srsName="EPSG:2154">662233.0 6861519.0</gml:pos>

### Quay

Each `Quay` node corresponds to an NTFS `stop_point` and is of type `ZE`
(__Zone d'embarquement__).  All `Quay` elements are grouped into a `members`
element which itself is wrapped into a `GeneralFrame`.

Netex field | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | ---
Quay/@id | stops.txt | stop_id | see [id formatting](#id-of-objects)
Quay/@version | | | fixed value `any`.
Quay/Name | stops.txt | stop_name |
Quay/Centroid/Location | stops.txt | stop_lat and stop_lon | see [Coordinates conversion](#coordinates-conversion)
Quay/TransportMode | | | see (2) below
Quay/tariffZones/TariffZoneRef/@ref | stops.txt | fare_zone_id | The fare zone is prefixed by the `ParticipantRef` prefix with a `:` separator
Quay/PublicCode | stops.txt | stop_code | This node may not be present if the stop_point has no `stop_code`.
Quay/AccessibilityAssessment | stops.txt | equipment_id | This node is present only if the `equipment_id` is specified. see [`AccessibilityAssessment`](#accessibilityassessment) below.

**(2) definition of the TransportMode**
As a stop_point can be associated to several physical_modes, all the
physical_modes need to be mapped to the Netex list (see [NeTEx Transport
Modes](#netex-transport-modes)).
If more than one Netex mode is associated, use the mode of __highest priority__ (see [NTFS
specifications](https://github.com/CanalTP/ntfs-specification/blob/v0.11.0/ntfs_fr.md#physical_modestxt-requis)).


#### AccessibilityAssessment

If the stop_point is associated to an equipment, a node `AccessibilityAssessment` is created and its content is as follow:

Netex field | NTFS file | NTFS field | Note
--- | --- | --- | ---
AccessibilityAssessment/@id | stops.txt | equipment_id | 
AccessibilityAssessment/MobilityImpairedAccess | | | see (1) below
AccessibilityAssessment/ limitations/AccessibilityLimitation/ WheelchairAccess | equipments.txt | wheelchair_boarding | see (2) below
AccessibilityAssessment/ limitations/AccessibilityLimitation/ AudibleSignsAvailable | equipments.txt | audible_announcement | see (2) below
AccessibilityAssessment/ limitations/AccessibilityLimitation/ VisualSignsAvailable | equipments.txt | visual_announcement | see (2) below

**(1) definition of MobilityImpairedAccess**

As stated in `NF_Profil NeTEx éléments communs(F) - v2.1.pdf` in chapter 5.10:
`AccessibilityAssessment` is optional, but if it's present, `MobilityImpairedAccess` is mandatory. Therefore, `MobilityImpairedAccess` sould be set to:
- `true` if all `AccessibilityLimitation` are set to `true`
- `false` if all `AccessibilityLimitation` are set to `false`
- `partial` if some `AccessibilityLimitation` are set to `true`
- `unknow` in other cases

**(2) value of limitations**

NTFS accessibility value | Netex accessibility value
--- | ---
0 or undefined | `undefined` 
1 | `true`
2 | `false`

### StopPlace
`StopPlace` is of 2 different types:
- `LMO` (__Lieu d'arrêt mono-modal__): Mono-modal with a unique name, regrouping
  `Quay`
- `LMU` (__Lieu d'arrêt multi-modal__): Multi-modal, regrouping multiple
  `StopPlace` of type `LMO` or `PM`

`stop_area` can be associated to several `physical_mode`.  All the
`physical_modes` need to be mapped to the Netex list (see [NeTEx Transport
Modes](#netex-transport-modes)).  For each mode, a `StopPlace` of type `LMO` is
created.  An additionnal `LMU` is created to regroup them.

#### StopPlaceType mapping
The `StopPlace/StopPlaceType` is defined from its `StopPlace/TransportMode`.

NeTEx Mode | StopPlaceType
--- | ---
air | Airport
bus | busStation
cableway | liftStation
coach | coachStation
funicular | railStation
metro | metroStation
rail | railStation
tram | tramStation
water | ferryStop

**(1) Sequence for ValidDayBits**

This is a string sequence of `0` (inactive days) and `1` (active days).  The
sequence should contains as many `0/1` as there is days in the period.  The
first character correspond to the first day of the period.
